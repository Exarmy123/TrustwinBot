- At exactly 12:01 AM IST, a random winner is picked from the ticket holders (for that day).
- Winner gets reward in USDT instantly (TRC-20), and name is saved in Supabase `winners` table.
- All users notified daily about the winner.

âœ… 5. **Fake History Display**
- `/winners` command shows last 7 fake+real winners in a formatted list (to build trust).
- Add fake entries when no one wins.

    - `/stats`: See total users, total tickets today.
    - `/users`: List of active users.

    - `users`: id, name, username, referrer_id, join_date
    - `tickets`: user_id, ticket_count, date
    - `referrals`: referrer_id, referred_id
    - `winners`: user_id, amount, date
    - `messages`: daily messages

âœ… 9. **USDT Transaction System**
